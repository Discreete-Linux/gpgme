          ===================================================

Installation should be pretty easy:
-----------------------------------

  * Get and install the latest GnuPG binary for windows
    (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip)
  
  * Check that you have an untampered version of this package by
    comparing an MD5SUM against the one on the webpage or by checking
    the signature of the package using "gpg --verify".  See the
    webpacge for details.

  * Because you are reading this file, you probably have already
    unpacked it distribution using a unzip utility :-). You should
    find these files:

       README      - This file
       gpgcom.exe  - The Gpgcom server
       vbtest.html - A Test webpage 
       vbtest.vbs  - A VB script to be used with the cscript utility

   * If you are updating Gpgcom, run the old Gpgcom like this:

       c:\gnupg\gpgcom -UnregServer

     (Replace c:\gnupg with the actually used path)

   * Copy the file gpgcom.exe to a some location. C:\gnupg seems to be
     a good choice. 

   * Register the component using this command:

      c:\gnupg\gpgcom -RegServer

   * Ready

Testing the installation:
-------------------------

  * Make sure that you have a working GnuPG (gpg.exe) and that at least
    one key is installed.

  * Edit the vbtest.vbs script and replace "alice" in the line

      gpg.AddRecipient "alice"

   with a keyID or user name you have in your key ring.

  * Run the test script:

      cscript vbtest.vbs

    and you should see a valid MIME message with the encrypted text.

    
Using Gpgcom
------------ 

Gpgcom currently support only encryption but will be extended to the
full range of operations GnuPG provides. The 2 examples should goive
yopu a hint on how to use it.  We suggest that you always set armor to
true, so that the returned text is a string.  If you don't use armor,
the "ciphertext" property will return an array with the binary
message.
