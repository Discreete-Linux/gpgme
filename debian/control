Description: GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy (development files)
 GPGME is a wrapper library which provides a C API to access some of the
 GnuPG functions, such as encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, ...
 .
 This package contains the headers and other files needed to compile
 against this library.

Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library (Python 3)
 Pyme is, for the most part, a direct interface to the C GPGME
 library.  However, it is re-packaged in a more Pythonic way --
 object-oriented with classes and modules.  Take a look at the classes
 defined here -- they correspond directly to certain object types in GPGME
 for C.
 .
 Features:
  * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library. Supports
    all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
    Callback functions may be written in pure Python.
  * Ability to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify data.
  * Ability to list keys, export and import keys, and manage the keyring.
  * Fully object-oriented with convenient classes and modules.
 .
 This is the official upstream Python 3 binding for GPGME.
