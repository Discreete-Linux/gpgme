# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line
# option "--options filename"), GnuPG uses the file ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
# by default.
#
# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '#',
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# See the man page for a list of options.

# By default GnuPG creates version 3 signatures for data files.  This
# is not strictly OpenPGP compliant but PGP 6 and most versions of PGP
# 7 require them.  To disable this behavior, you may use this option
# or --openpgp.
