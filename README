                  GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy
                ---------------------------

             !!!! THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

If you want to hack on it, start with one of the `tests/gpg/t-foo'
programs.

To build GPGME, you need to install libgpg-error.  You need at least
libgpg-error 0.5.

For support of the OpenPGP protocol (default), you need the latest CVS
version of GnuPG 1.2, see `http://www.gnupg.org/cvs-access.html'.

You need at least GnuPG 1.2.2.

If configure can't find the `gpg' binary in your path, you can specify
the location with the --with-gpg=/path/to/gpg argument to configure.

For support of the CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) protocol, you
need the latest CVS version of GpgSM, module name `newpg', at
`:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnupg.org:/cvs/aegypten'.

You need at least GpgSM 0.9.0.

If configure can't find the `gpgsm' binary in your path, you can
specify the location with the --with-gpgsm=/path/to/gpgsm argument to
configure.

For building the CVS version please see the file README.CVS

Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want
to do serious work.
