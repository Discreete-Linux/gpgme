                  GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy
                ---------------------------

             !!!! THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

If you want to hack on it, start with one of the tests/t-foo programs.
You need the latest CVS version of GnuPG 1.0, see
http://www.gnupg.org/cvs-access.html .  

You need at least GnuPG 1.0.6  (but don't use a 1.1.x version).


To build the W32 version, use 
./autogen.sh --build-w32


Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want
to do serious work. 


gpgmeplug/ is experimental and you should not assume that it will stay
with gpgme.
