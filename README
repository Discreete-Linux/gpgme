                  GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy
                ---------------------------

             !!!! THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

If you want to hack on it, start with one of the `tests/gpg/t-foo'
programs.

For support of the OpenPGP protocol (default), you need the latest CVS
version of GnuPG 1.2, see `http://www.gnupg.org/cvs-access.html'.

You need at least GnuPG 1.2.2.

If configure can't find the `gpg' binary in your path, you can specify
the location with the --with-gpg=/path/to/gpg argument to configure.

For support of the CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) protocol, you
need the latest CVS version of GpgSM, module name `newpg', at
`:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnupg.org:/cvs/aegypten'.

You need at least GpgSM 0.9.0.

If configure can't find the `gpgsm' binary in your path, you can
specify the location with the --with-gpgsm=/path/to/gpgsm argument to
configure.

Before building the CVS version following the generic install
instructions in `INSTALL', you need to set up the build scripts with
`./autogen.sh'.  To build the W32 version, use `./autogen.sh
--build-w32'.  You also need to enable maintainer mode at configure
time with `--enable-maintainer-mode', or the documentation will not
built (because the version.texi won't be generated unless maintainer
mode is enabled).

Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want
to do serious work.
