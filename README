                  GPGME - GnuPG Made Easy
                ---------------------------

             !!!! THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

If you want to hack on it, start with one of the tests/t-foo programs.
You need the latest CVS version of GnuPG 1.0, see
http://www.gnupg.org/cvs-access.html .  If you use passphrases for
your keys, you should get the gpg-agent which comes with the GnuPG
unstable version (either CVS HEAD or
ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/gnupg-1.1.2.tar.gz) and install
the agent from the agent subdirectory.

Please subscribe to the gnupg-devel@gnupg.org mailing list if you want
to do serious work.
