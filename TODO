Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*- mode!

* Before release:
** Change gpgme_invalid_user_id_t to gpgme_invalid_key_t.
** gpgme-config must include info about libgpg-error.

* ABI's to break:
** Compatibility interfaces that can be removed in future versions:
*** gpgme_data_new_from_filepart
*** gpgme_data_new_from_file
*** gpgme_data_new_with_read_cb
*** gpgme_data_rewind
*** gpgme_op_import_ext
*** gpgme_get_sig_key
*** gpgme_get_sig_ulong_attr
*** gpgme_get_sig_string_attr
*** GPGME_SIG_STAT_*
*** gpgme_get_sig_status
*** gpgme_trust_item_release
*** gpgme_trust_item_get_string_attr
*** gpgme_trust_item_get_ulong_attr
*** gpgme_attr_t
*** All Gpgme* typedefs.

* Thread support:
** Build thread modules for static linking (which just suck in the
   desired symbols the hard way). !!
** Ordering the libs is important, but libtool gets it wrong.  Argh.

* New features:
** notification system
   We need a simple notification system, probably a simple callback
   with a string and some optional arguments.  This is for example
   required to notify an application of a changed smartcard,  The
   application can then do whatever is required.  There are other
   usages too.  This notfication system should be independent of any
   contextes of course.
** --learn-code support
   This might be integrated with import. we still need to work out how
   to learn a card when gpg and gpgsm have support for smartcards.
** set_locale for thread safe and env independent locale selection.
** How to terminate a pending operation?  Something like gpgme_op_reset,
   but where are you allowed to call it (think callback handlers).
   Then gpgme_op_*list_end can go.
** Might need a stat() for data objects and use it for length param to gpg.
** Allow to export secret keys.
** Implement support for photo ids.
** New features requested by our dear users, but rejected or left for
   later consideration:
*** Selecting the key ring, setting the version or comment in output.
    Rejected because the naive implementation is engine specific, the
    configuration is part of the engine's configuration or readily
    worked around in a different way
*** Selecting the symmetric cipher.
*** Exchanging keys with key servers.

* Documentation
** Document validity and trust issues.

* Engines
** Do not create/destroy engines, but create engine and then reset it.
   Internally the reset operation still spawns a new engine process,
   but this can be replaced with a reset later.  Also, be very sure to
   release everything properly at a reset and at an error.  Think hard
   about where to guarantee what (ie, what happens if start fails, are
   the fds unregistered immediately - i think so?)
** Optimize the case where a data object has an underlying fd we can pass
   directly to the engine.
** Move code common to all engines up from gpg to engine.
** engine operations can return General Error on unknown protocol
   (it's an internal error, as select_protocol checks already).
** When server mode is implemented properly, more care has to be taken to
   release all resources on error (for example to free assuan_cmd).

* Operations
** If no passphrase cb is installed, status handler is not run even if
   password is required by crypto engine. !!
** Export status handler need much more work. !!!
** Import should return a useful error when one happened.
*** Import does not take notice of NODATA status report.
*** When GPGSM does issue IMPORT_OK status reports, make sure to check for them
    in tests/gpgs m/t-import.c.
** Genkey should return something more useful than General_Error.
** Factor out common code in _op_*_start functions.
** Optimize the file descriptor list, so the number of open fds is
   always known easily.
** Encryption: It should be verified that the behaviour for partially untrusted
   recipients is correct.
** When GPG issues INV_something for invalid signers, catch them.

* Error Values
** Map ASSUAN/GpgSM ERR error values in a better way than is done now. !!
** Some error values should identify the source more correctly (mostly error
   values derived from status messages).

* Tests
** Write a fake gpg-agent so that we can supply known passphrases to
   gpgsm and setup the configuration files to use the agent.  Without
   this we are testing a currently running gpg-agent which is not a
   clever idea. !
** t-data
*** Test gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem.
*** Test gpgme_data_seek for invalid types.

* Debug
** Handle malloc and vasprintf errors.  But decide first if they should be
   ignored (and logged with 255?!), or really be assertions. !

* Build suite
** Make sure everything is cleaned correctly (esp. test area).
