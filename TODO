Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*- mode!

* ABI's to break:
** string representation of non-secret keys and ATTR_IS_SECRET is NULL,
   which can not be differentiated from the case that it is not
   representable.

* Allow to use GTK's main loop instead of the select stuff in
  wait.c

* add locking to the key cache?

* Documentation
** Add note about GPGME clearing out pointer return values.
** validity/trust
** Document gpgme.m4

* Engines
** Move code common to all engines up from gpg to engine.
** engine operations can return General Error on unknown protocol
   (it's an internal error, as select_protocol checks already).
** When server mode is implemented properly, more care has to be taken to
    release all resources on error (for example to free assuan_cmd).
** GnuPG
*** For pipemode, make sure to release the pipemode callback data object.

* Operations
** Export status handler need much more work.
** Import should return a useful error when one happened.
** Genkey should return something more useful than General_Error.
** Factor out common code in _op_*_start functions.
** Add ATTR to return the number of subkeys or uids.
** "When returning a GpgmeKey GPGME_ATTR_COMMENT attribute, characters  
   like ":" are not un-escaped, they are returned as \x3a" Bug
   reported by Stephane Corthesy.


* Error Values
** Map ASSUAN/GpgSM ERR error values in a better way than is done now.
** Verify (and document) if Read_Error, Write_Error, Pipe_Error set errno.

* Tests
** Write a fake gpg-agent so that we can supply known passphrases to
   gpgsm and setup the configuration files to use the agent.  Without
   this we are testing a currently running gpg-agent which is not a
   clever idea.
** t-data
*** Test gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem.
*** Test gpgme_data_rewind for invalid types.
*** Test gpgme_data_read's readable feature.

* Build suite
** Make sure everything is cleaned correctly (esp. test area).

* Architecture support
** (nothing currently)
