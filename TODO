Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*- mode!

* ABI's to break:
** Currently none.

* Thread support:
** Build thread modules for static linking (which just suck in the
   desired symbols the hard way). !!

* New features:
** notification system
   We need a simple notification system, probably a a simple callback
   with a string and some optional arguments.  This is for example
   required to notify an application of a changed smartcard,  The
   application can then do whatever is required.  There are other
   usages too.  This notfication system should be independent of any
   contextes of course.
** --learn-code support
   This might be integrated with import. we still need to work out how
   to learn a card when gpg and gpgsm have support for smartcards.

* Documentation
** Add note about GPGME clearing out pointer return values.
** validity/trust

* Engines
** Optimize the case where a data object has an underlying fd we can pass
   directly to the engine.
** Move code common to all engines up from gpg to engine.
** engine operations can return General Error on unknown protocol
   (it's an internal error, as select_protocol checks already).
** When server mode is implemented properly, more care has to be taken to
    release all resources on error (for example to free assuan_cmd).
** GnuPG
*** For pipemode, make sure to release the pipemode callback data object.
    Note, pipemode will eventually be replaced by an Assuan interface to gpg.

* Operations
** Passphrase callback should not copy password. !!!
** Export status handler need much more work. !!!
** Import should return a useful error when one happened.
** Genkey should return something more useful than General_Error.
** Factor out common code in _op_*_start functions.
** Add ATTR to return the number of subkeys or uids.

* Error Values
** Map ASSUAN/GpgSM ERR error values in a better way than is done now. !!
** Verify (and document) if Read_Error, Write_Error, Pipe_Error set errno.

* Tests
** Write a fake gpg-agent so that we can supply known passphrases to
   gpgsm and setup the configuration files to use the agent.  Without
   this we are testing a currently running gpg-agent which is not a
   clever idea. !
** t-data
*** Test gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem.
*** Test gpgme_data_rewind for invalid types.
*** Test gpgme_data_read's readable feature.

* Debug
** Handle malloc and vasprintf errors.  But decide first if they should be
   ignored (and logged with 255?!), or really be assertions. !

* Build suite
** Make sure everything is cleaned correctly (esp. test area).
