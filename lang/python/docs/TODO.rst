Documentation

Currently this appears to be buried in the debian/ directory for some
unknown reason, probably pertaining to one of the other developers.
Documentation is to be moved to a more appropriate docs/ directory and
produced using reST in preparation for inevitable publication by way
of Sphinx and the existing infrastructure at readthedocs.org or the
projects new home at gnupg.org.
