Example Scripts
===============

Most of the examples have been converted to work with Python 3, just as the original versions worked with Python 2.  A small number produce errors on OS X, but may behave differently on other POSIX systems.  The GTK based scripts (PyGtkGpgKeys.py and pygpa.py) have not been modified at all.

When using or referring to the example scripts here, the most common change has been the byte encoded strings, so if something does not work then chances are that it will be related to the encoding or decoding of UTF-8.
