PyME - GPGME for Python          emacs, please switch to -*- org -*- mode
=======================

PyMe is a python interface to the GPGME library:
https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/

PyMe uses SWIG to create wrapper functions with automatic type
conversions.  This way most of the functions and types are converted
from C into Python 3 automatically by SWIG, reducing the maintenance
cost of the binginds.

* Authors

PyME has been created by John Goerzen, and maintained, developed, and
cherished by Igor Belyi, Martin Albrecht, Ben McGinnes, and everyone
who contributed to it in any way.

In 2016 we merged a port of PyME to into the GPGME repository, and
development will continue there.  Please see the VCS history for the
list of contributors, and if you do find bugs, or want to contribute,
please get in touch and help maintain PyME.

Please see the section 'History' further down this document for
references to previous versions.
