gpg - GPGME bindings for Python                                      -*- org -*-
=======================

The "gpg" module is a python interface to the GPGME library:
https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/

"gpg" offers two interfaces, one is a high-level, curated, and
idiomatic interface that is implemented as a shim on top of the
low-level interface automatically created using SWIG.

This way we make simple things easy, while still providing the entire
functionality of the underlying library.

PyME was created by John Goerzen, and maintained, developed, and
cherished by Igor Belyi, Martin Albrecht, Ben McGinnes, and everyone
who contributed to it in any way.

In 2016 we merged a port of PyME to into the GPGME repository, and
development will continue there.  Please see the VCS history for the
list of contributors, and if you do find bugs, or want to contribute,
please get in touch and help maintain the python gpg bindings.

Please see the section 'History' further down this document for
