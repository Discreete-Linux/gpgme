Overview
--------
QGpgme provides Qt API bindings around Gpgmepp. It depends on Gpgmepp.

Currently this is a very thin library that only provides a QByteArray
and QIODevice dataprovider. But might be extended in the future with
code that is currently part of KDE's libkleopatra. To provide an easy
to use API for Qt Applications.
