PyME
====

PyMe is a python interface to the `GPGME
<https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/>`_ library.

PyMe's development model is a `GPGME
<https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/>`_ + Python 3 + `SWIG
<http://www.swig.org/>`_ combination which means that most of the functions and
types are converted from C into Python 3 automatically by SWIG. In short, to be
able to use PyMe you need to be `familiar with GPGME
<https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gpgme/>`_.
