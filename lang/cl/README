Common Lisp Support for GPGME
-----------------------------

Requirements:

ASDF		Packaging Support
CFFI		Foreign Function Interface
gpg-error	GPG Error Codes

Use with:

> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op ':gpgme)


Examples
--------

(with-open-file (stream "/tmp/myout" :direction :output
			:if-exists :supersede :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
  (with-context (ctx)
    (setf (armor-p ctx) t)
    (op-export ctx "DEADBEEF" out)))

(with-context (ctx)
  (with-output-to-string (out)
    (setf (armor-p ctx) t)
    (op-export ctx "McTester" out)))

(gpgme:with-context (ctx :armor t)
  (with-output-to-string (out)
    (gpgme:op-export ctx "McTester" out)))


TODO
----

* When GPGME defines macros for include cert values -2, -1, 0 and 1,
  define lisp macros for them as well.
