Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.9 (unreleased)
------------------------------------------------

 * A spec file for for creating RPMs has been added.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.8 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.8 (2002-06-25)
------------------------------------------------

 * It is possible to use an outside event loop for the I/O to the
   crypto engine by setting the I/O callbacks with gpgme_set_io_cbs.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.6 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GpgmeIOCb			NEW
GpgmeRegisterIOCb		NEW
GpgmeRemoveIOCb			NEW
GpgmeEventIO			NEW
GpgmeEventIOCb			NEW
struct GpgmeIOCbs		NEW
gpgme_set_io_cbs		NEW
gpgme_get_io_cbs		NEW
GPGME_ATTR_ERRTOK		NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.7 (2002-06-04)
------------------------------------------------

 * GPGME_ATTR_OTRUST is implemented now.

 * A first step toward thread safeness has been achieved, see the
   documentation for details.  Supported thread libraries are pthread
   and Pth.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.6 (2002-05-03)
------------------------------------------------

 * All error output of the gpgsm backend is send to the bit bucket.

 * The signature verification functions are extended.  Instead of
   always returning GPGME_SIG_STATUS_GOOD, the functions new codes for
   expired signatures.  2 new functions may be used to retrieve more
   detailed information like the signature expiration time and a
   validity information of the key without an extra key looking.

 * The current passphrase callback and progress meter callback can be
   retrieved with the new functions gpgme_get_passphrase_cb and
   gpgme_get_progress_cb respectively.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.5 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_get_passphrase_cb		NEW
gpgme_get_progress_cb		NEW
GpgmeDataEncoding               NEW
gpgme_data_set_encoding         NEW
gpgme_data_get_encoding         NEW
GPGME_SIG_STAT_GOOD_EXP         NEW
GPGME_SIG_STAT_GOOD_EXPKEY      NEW
gpgme_op_verify                 CHANGED: Returns more status codes.
GPGME_ATTR_SIG_STATUS           NEW
gpgme_get_sig_string_attr       NEW
gpgme_get_sig_ulong_attr        NEW
gpgme_get_protocol              NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.5 (2002-04-01)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpgme_op_encrypt can be called with RECIPIENTS being 0.  In this
   case, symmetric encryption is performed.  Note that this requires a
   passphrase from the user.

 * More information is returned for X.509 certificates.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.4 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_op_encrypt		EXTENDED: Symmetric encryption possible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.4 (2002-03-04)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpgme_op_encrypt does now fail with GPGME_Invalid_Recipients if
   some recipients have been invalid, whereas earlier versions
   succeeded in this case.  The plaintext is still encrypted for all valid
   recipients, so the application might take this error as a hint that
   the ciphertext is not usable for all requested recipients.
   Information about invalid recipients is available with gpgme_get_op_info.

 * gpgme_op_verify now allows to pass an uninitialized data object as
   its plaintext argument to check for normal and cleartext
   signatures.  The plaintext is then returned in the data object.

 * New interfaces gpgme_set_include_certs and gpgme_get_include_certs
   to set and get the number of certifications to include in S/MIME
   signed messages.

 * New interfaces gpgme_op_encrypt_sign and gpgme_op_encrypt_sign_start
   to encrypt and sign a message in a combined operation.

 * New interface gpgme_op_keylist_ext_start to search for multiple patterns.

 * gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr supports the GPGME_ATTR_EXPIRE attribute.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.3 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_op_encrypt		CHANGED: Can fail with GPGME_Invalid_Recipients
gpgme_op_verify			EXTENDED: Accepts uninitialized text argument
gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr	EXTENDED: Supports GPGME_ATTR_EXPIRE
gpgme_set_include_certs		NEW
gpgme_get_include_certs		NEW
gpgme_op_encrypt_sign		NEW
gpgme_op_encrypt_sign_start	NEW
gpgme_op_keylist_ext_start	NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.3 (2002-02-12)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fix the Makefile in jnlib.

 * Fix the test suite (hopefully).  It should clean up all its state
   with `make check' now.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.2 (2002-02-10)
------------------------------------------------

 * Remove erroneous dependency on libgcrypt in jnlib.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.1 (2002-02-09)
------------------------------------------------

 * There is a Texinfo manual documenting the API.

 * The gpgme_set_keylist_mode function returns an error, and changed
   its meaning.  It is no longer usable to select between normal and
   fast mode (newer versions of GnuPG will always be fast), but
   selects between local keyring, remote keyserver, or both.
   For this, two new macros are defined, GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL
   and GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN.  To make it possible to modify the
   current setting, a fucntion gpgme_get_keylist_mode was added to
   retrieve the current mode.

 * gpgme_wait accepts a new argument STATUS to return the error status
   of the operation on the context.  Its definition is closer to
   waitpid() now than before.

 * The LENGTH argument to gpgme_data_new_from_filepart changed its
   type from off_t to the unsigned size_t.

 * The R_HD argument to the GpgmePassphraseCb type changed its type
   from void* to void**.

 * New interface gpgme_op_trustlist_end() to match
   gpgme_op_keylist_end().

 * The CryptPlug modules have been renamed to gpgme-openpgp and
   gpgme-smime, and they are installed in pkglibdir by `make install'.

 * An idle function can be registered with gpgme_register_idle().

 * The GpgSM backend supports key generation with gpgme_op_genkey().

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.0 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_data_new_from_filepart	CHANGED: Type of LENGTH is size_t.
GpgmePassphraseCb               CHANGED: Type of R_HD is void **.
gpgme_wait                      CHANGED: New argument STATUS.
gpgme_set_keylist_mode          CHANGED: Type of return value is GpgmeError.
                                The function has a new meaning!
gpgme_get_keylist_mode          NEW
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL        NEW
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN       NEW
gpgme_op_trustlist_next		NEW
GpgmeIdleFunc                   NEW
gpgme_register_idle             NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.0 (2001-12-19)
------------------------------------------------
 
 * New interface gpgme_set_protocol() to set the protocol and thus the
   crypto engine to be used by the context.  Currently, the OpenPGP
   and the CMS protocols are supported.  They are specified by the new
   preprocessor symbols GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP and GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS.
   A new context uses the OpenPGP engine by default.

 * gpgme_get_engine_info() returns information for all crypto engines
   compiled into the library.  The XML format has changed.  To
   reliably get the version of a crypto engine, the <version> tag
   after the appropriate <protocol> tag has to be looked for.

 * New interface gpgme_engine_check_version(), obsoleting
   gpgme_check_engine().  Check the version of all engines you are
   supporting in your software.

 * GpgmeKey lists the user ids in the order as they are returned by
   GnuPG, first the primary key with index 0, then the sub-user ids.

 * New operation gpgme_op_decrypt_verify() to decrypt and verify
   signatures simultaneously.

 * The new interface gpgme_op_keylist_end() terminates a pending
   keylist operation.  A keylist operation is also terminated when
   gpgme_op_keylist_next() returns GPGME_EOF.

 * GPGME can be compiled without GnuPG being installed (`--with-gpg=PATH'),
   cross-compiled, or even compiled without support for GnuPG
   (`--without-gpg').

 * GPGME can be compiled with support for GpgSM (GnuPG for S/MIME,
   `--with-gpgsm=PATH').  It is enabled by default if the `gpgsm' is found
   in the path, but it can also be compiled without support for GpgSM
   (`--without-gpgsm').

 * CryptPlug modules for GPGME are included and can be enabled at
   configure time (`--enable-gpgmeplug').  There is one module which
   uses the GnuPG engine (`gpgmeplug') and one module which uses the
   GpgSM engine (`gpgsmplug').

 * Interface changes relative to the latest 0.2.x release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_key_get_as_xml		CHANGED: Sub-user ids reversed in order.
gpgme_key_get_string_attr	CHANGED: User ids reversed in order.
gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr	CHANGED: User ids reversed in order.
gpgme_get_engine_info		CHANGED: New format, extended content.
gpgme_engine_check_version	NEW
gpgme_decrypt_verify_start	NEW
gpgme_decrypt_verify		NEW
gpgme_op_keylist_next		NEW
gpgme_set_protocol		NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.3 (2001-09-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * New function gpgme_get_op_info which can be used to get the micalg
   parameter needed for MOSS.

 * New functions gpgme_get_armor and gpgme_get_textmode.

 * The usual bug fixes and some minor functionality improvements.

 * Added a simple encryption component for MS-Windows; however the
   build procedure might have some problems.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.2 (2001-06-12)
------------------------------------------------
 
 * Implemented a key cache.

 * Fixed a race condition under W32 and some other bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.1 (2001-04-02)
------------------------------------------------

 * Changed debug output and GPGME_DEBUG variable (gpgme/debug.c)

 * Handle GnuPG's new key capabilities output and support revocation
   et al. attributes

 * Made the W32 support more robust.
