Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.2 (2012-05-02)
------------------------------------------------

 * Remove support for libgpgme-pth.  As far as we know, this was never used,
   and GnuPG is going to use our own npth in the future.

 * Fix signature summary information for a missing X.509 key.

 * Fix parsing of dates >= year 2038.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.1 (2011-06-16)
------------------------------------------------

 * Ported to Windows CE.

 * Detect GPG versions not supporting ---passwd.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.3.0 release:

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.0 (2010-01-11)
------------------------------------------------

 * GPGME does not come with an internal libassuan version anymore.
   The external libassuan 1.1.0 release or later is required.  For
   application programmers on systems that can resolve inter-library
   dependencies at runtime, this is a transparent change.

 * New engine GPGME_PROTOCOL_G13 to support the new g13 tool.

 * New engine GPGME_PROTOCOL_UISERVER to support UI Servers.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.2.0 (2009-06-18)
------------------------------------------------

 * New encryption flag GPGME_ENCRYPT_NO_ENCRYPT_TO to disable default
   recipients.

 * gpgme_new will fail if gpgme_check_version was not called, or a
   selftest failed (for example, if -mms-bitfields was not used on
   MingW32 targets).

 * New functions gpgme_io_read and gpgme_io_write for use with
   gpgme_passphrase_cb_t and gpgme_edit_cb_t functions.

 * New functions gpgme_result_ref and gpgme_result_unref to detach
   result structures from a context.

 * New functions gpgme_op_export_keys_start and gpgme_op_export_keys
   that allow to specify exported keys through gpgme_key_t objects
   instead of patterns.

 * New mode of operation gpgme_export_mode_t that allows exporting
   external keys.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.1.7 release:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EPHEMERAL   NEW.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.8 (2008-12-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * SIGPIPE is now again ignored as described in the manual.  Fixes
   regresion introduced with 1.1.6.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.7 (2008-10-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * Using GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL combined with
   GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN is now supported; it uses the
   --locate-keys feature of gpg (>= 2.0.10).

 * The encoding of gpgme_data_t objects can affect the output encoding
   of export, sign and encrypt operations now (the same operations
   that are also affected by the ASCII mode switch).  We believe this
   change in the ABI is innocent enough not to break existing
   applications (it only affects the S/MIME backend on certain
   operations).

 * The reference manual now includes the specification of "The GnuPG
   UI Server protocol".

 * A new function gpgme_cancel_async can be used to asynchronously
   cancel any pending operation at any time, from any thread.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.1.6 release:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_op_encrypt		CHANGED: Output encoding can affect result.
gpgme_op_encrypt_start		CHANGED: Output encoding can affect result.
gpgme_op_encrypt_sign		CHANGED: Output encoding can affect result.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.6 (2008-01-04)
------------------------------------------------

 * Bug fixes for for W32.

 * A new, experimental (and thus undocumented and potentially
   unstable) interface for accessing gpg-conf through GPGME has been
   added.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.1.1 release:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 gpgme_signature_t               EXTENDED: New field chain_model.
 gpgme_op_getauditlog_start      NEW.

 GPGME_AUDITLOG_HTML             NEW.
 GPGME_AUDITLOG_WITH_HELP        NEW.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.5 (2007-07-09)
------------------------------------------------

 * Bug and portability fixes (mainly for W32).


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.4 (2007-03-05)
------------------------------------------------

 * Detect and bail out on double plaintext messages.  This is required
   so that applications can properly detect the signed parts of a
   message.  Actual there is now a double protection as GnuPG 1.4.7
   will detect this case too.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.3 (2007-01-29)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a memory leak in gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem.

 * Fixed a bug in Windows command line quoting.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.2 (2006-03-02)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a bug in the W32 glib backend.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.1 (2006-02-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a bug in that the fingerprints of subkeys are not available.

 * Clarified usage of the SECRET flag in key listings.  It is now
   reset for stub keys.

 * Reading signature notations and policy URLs on key signatures is
   supported.  They can be found in the new field notations of the
   gpgme_key_sig_t structure.  This has to be enabled with the keylist
   mode flag GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIG_NOTATIONS.

 * A new gpgme_free() function solves the problem of using different
   allocators in a single program.  This function should now be used
   instead calling free() to release the buffer returned by
   gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem.  It is recommended that you always
   do this, but it is only necessary on certain platforms, so backwards
   compatibility is provided.  In other words: If free() worked for
   you before, it will keep working.

 * New status codes GPGME_PKA_TRUST_GOOD and GPGME_PKA_TRUST_BAD.
   They are analyzed by the verify handlers and made available in the
   new PKA_TRUST and PKA_ADDRESS fields of the signature result structure.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.1.0 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_key_sig_t			EXTENDED: New field notations.
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIG_NOTATIONS NEW

GPGME_STATUS_PKA_TRUST_GOOD     NEW
gpgme_signature_t               EXTENDED: New field pka_trust.
gpgme_signature_t               EXTENDED: New field pka_address.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.0 (2005-10-01)
------------------------------------------------

 * You can now configure the backend engine file name and home
   directory to be used, as default and per context.

 * Information about the recipients of an encrypted text is now
   available at decryption time.

 * New status GPGME_STATUS_PLAINTEXT.  This is analyzed by the decrypt
   and verify handlers, the information about the plaintext filename,
   if available is made available in the new field file_name of the
   respective result structure.

 * The code for "automagically detecting the thread library" has been
   removed from libgpgme.  It is deprecated since version 0.4.3.
   Since then, you had to link against libgpgme-pthread for
   applications using pthread and libgpgme-pth for applications using
   GNU Pth.

   The code was removed because it caused compilation problems on
   systems where the pthread.h header from GNU Pth is available in
   addition to the system header (FreeBSD 6 and later for example).

 * "./autogen.sh --build-w32" does now build gpgme.dll.

 * [W32] The environment variable GPGME_DEBUG now uses a semicolon as
   delimiter.  The standard install directory is used when locating
   gpg or gpgsm before finally falling back to the hardwired name.

 * There is a new flag for keys and subkeys, is_qualified, which
   indicates if a key can be used for qualified signatures according
   to local government regulations.

 * You can associate a filename with a data object using the new
   function gpgme_data_set_file_name().  This filename will be stored
   in the output when encrypting or signing the data and will be
   returned when decrypting or verifying the output data.

 * You can now set notation data at signature creation with the new
   function gpgme_sig_notation_add().

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.0.3 release:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.3 (2005-06-20)
------------------------------------------------

 * Previousy, GPGME would use a default "include certs" of 1.  This
   has been changed.  Now GPGME will use the crypto backend engines
   default unless you set the value with gpgme_set_include_certs()
   explicitely.  A new macro GPGME_INCLUDE_CERTS_DEFAULT can be used
   as a value to explicitely request the new default behaviour.

   Because the default changes, this is a slight change of the API
   semantics.  We consider it to be a bug fix.

 * A bug which made GPGME hang has been fixed.  If you have
   experienced hanging before, please try out this version and let me
   know if you still experience hanging problems.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.9.0 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_set_include_certs		CHANGED DEFAULT
GPGME_INCLUDE_CERTS_DEFAULT	NEW
GPGME_STATUS_SIG_SUBPACKET	NEW

GPGME_STATUS_BACKUP_KEY_CREATED	NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.2 (2004-12-28)
------------------------------------------------

 * Changed the license of the library to the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL), version 2.1 or later.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.1 (2004-10-22)
------------------------------------------------

 * Only bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.0 (2004-09-30)
------------------------------------------------

 * Version 1.0.0!  We are proud to present you with a thoroughly
   tested and stable version of the GPGME library.  A big Thank You!
   to all the people who made this possible.

   The development will be branched into a stable 1.x.y series and the
   head.

 * The gpgme.m4 macro supports checking the API version.  Just prepend
   it to the required version string, separated by a colon.  For
   example, this release has the version "1:1.0.0".  The last release
   to which this version is (mostly) ABI compatible is "1:0.4.2",
   which is the default required version.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.0 (2004-06-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * The type gpgme_key_t has now a new field keylist_mode that contains
   the keylist mode that was active at the time the key was retrieved.

 * The type gpgme_decrypt_result_t has a new field "wrong_key_usage"
   that contains a flag indicating that the key should not have been
   used for encryption.

 * Verifying a signature of a revoked key gives the correct result now
   (GPG_ERR_CERT_REVOKED error code).

 * Clarified that the error code GPG_ERR_NO_DATA from the decrypt &
   verify operations still allows you to look at the signature
   verification result.

 * Clarified that patterns in keylisting operations have an upper
   limit, and thus are not suited to list many keys at once by their
   fingerprint.  Also improve the error message if the pattern is too
   long for the CMS protocol to handle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_key_t			EXTENDED: New field keylist_mode.
gpgme_decrypt_result_t		EXTENDED: New field wrong_key_usage.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.7 (2004-04-29)
------------------------------------------------

 * Correctly initialize the fields expired, revoked, invalid, and
   disabled in the gpgme_key_t structures.

 * A bug fix: The flag wrong_key_usage of gpgme_signature_t was
   accidently of type int instead unsigned int.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.4.5 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_signature_t		CHANGED: wrong_key_usage is unsigned int now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.6 (2004-04-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Bug fixes


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.5 (2004-03-07)
------------------------------------------------

 * GPGME is now compiled with LFS (large file support) by default.
   This means that _all_ programs using GPGME must be compiled with
   LFS support enabled by default.  You can do this easily with
   autoconf, by using the AC_SYS_LARGEFILE macro.  Or you can do this
   without autoconf by defining the preprocessor symbol
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS to 64 (by passing the -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to
   the C compiler command line, or by defining this preprocessor
   symbol before including any system header files).  For more
   details, read the section on LFS in the manual.

   Up to now, it was undocumented that GPGME was not using LFS.
   But the public interfaces use off_t, and file descriptors are
   exchanged between the application and GPGME.  This was an oversight,
   and bound to cause troubles in the future.

   Writing GPGME as a dual mode library that seamlessly supports LFS
   while keeping backwards compatibility is possible, but does not
   solve the problem: Many applications already expect GPGME to have
   LFS (they are compiled with off_t being a 64bit value).  This is true
   in particular for the popular Gtk+ and Qt programs.

   So, although this is an ABI (but not an API) break, we will not
   change the library version to reflect that.  Because the interfaces
   affected are probably not used yet in any GPGME 0.4 based
   application, we don't expect any real failures from this change.
   In fact, applications already using LFS will have some subtle bugs
   fixed.

   However, if you encounter an application using GPGME 0.4.x that
   does _not_ use LFS by default (off_t is a 32bit value), _and_
   uses at least one of the functions gpgme_data_seek,
   gpgme_data_new_from_filepart, or a gpgme_data_seek_cb_t with
   gpgme_data_new_from_cbs, then indeed this library will be ABI
   incompatible with the program.  As said above, we don't believe
   such a program exists.  If we are in error, then you have two
   options: As a quick hack, you can configure GPGME with the
   --disable-largefile option.  This will revert the change, and GPGME
   will not use LFS.  However, GPGME will be incompatible with
   programs that expect GPGME to use LFS.  All applications are
   required to use LFS when using GPGME, so this is only good as a
   temporary local work-around.

   The other option is to change the versioning of the library and
   recompile all applications.  We have reserved a special version of
   the library for that, so you can do that without expecting a
   version clash in the future.  Furthermore, everyone who does this
   will agree on the version to use (this is important for
   distribution makers).  Read the comment in configure.ac (before
   LIBGPGME_LT_AGE) if you want to do this.  Please don't do this
   blindly: As stated above, we think it is unlikely this measure is
   needed.  Still, it is there if necessary.  If in doubt, contact us
   and we will give our advise for your specific situation.

 * New key listing mode GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_VALIDATE for validation of
   the listed keys.

 * New interface gpgme_cancel() that can be used to cancel
   asynchronous operations.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.4.4 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_data_seek_cb_t		CHANGED: off_t is now a largefile type.
gpgme_data_seek			CHANGED: off_t is now a largefile type.
gpgme_data_new_from_filepart	CHANGED: off_t is now a largefile type.
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_VALIDATE     NEW
gpgme_cancel			NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.4 (2004-01-12)
------------------------------------------------

 * The member "class" in gpgme_key_sig_t and gpgme_new_signature_t has
   been renamed to "sig_class", to avoid clash with C++ compilers.  In
   the C API, the old name "class" has been preserved for backwards
   compatibility, but is deprecated.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.4.3 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_key_sig_t			CHANGED: class deprecated, use new sig_class.
gpgme_new_signature_t		CHANGED: class deprecated, use new sig_class.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.3 (2003-10-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * libgpgme should not be used for threaded programs anymore.  This
   never worked reliably in all cases, because you had to
   be careful about the linking order and libtool wouldn't do that for
   you automatically.  Instead, now you have to link against
   libgpgme-pthread for applications using pthread and libgpgme-pth for
   applications using GNU Pth.

   The old code for automagically detecting the thread library is
   still part of libgpgme, but it is DEPRECATED.

 * There are new automake macros AM_PATH_GPGME_PTH and
   AM_PATH_GPGME_PTHREAD, which support checking for thread-enabled
   versions of GPGME.  They define GPGME_PTH_CFLAGS, GPGME_PTH_LIBS,
   GPGME_PTHREAD_CFLAGS and GPGME_PTHREAD_LIBS respectively.  These
   variables of course also include the configuration for the thread
   package itself.  Alternatively, use libtool.

 * gpgme_strerror_r as a thread safe variant of gpgme_strerror was
   added.

 * gpgme-config doesn't support setting the prefix or exec prefix
   anymore.  I don't think it ever worked correctly, and it seems to
   be pointless.

 * gpgme_get_key fails with GPG_ERR_AMBIGUOUS_NAME if the key ID
   provided was not unique, instead returning the first matching key.

 * gpgme_key_t and gpgme_subkey_t have a new field, can_authenticate,
   that indicates if the key can be used for authentication.

 * gpgme_signature_t's status field is now correctly set to an error
   with error code GPG_ERR_NO_PUBKEY if public key is not found.

 * gpgme_new_signature_t's class field is now an unsigned int, rather
   than an unsigned long (the old class field is preserved for
   backwards compatibility).

 * A new function gpgme_set_locale() is provided to allow configuring
   the locale for the crypto backend.  This is necessary for text
   terminals so that programs like the pinentry can be started with
   the right locale settings for the terminal the application is running
   on, in case the terminal has different settings than the system
   default (for example, if it is a remote terminal).  You are highly
   recommended to call the following functions directly after
   gpgme_check_version:

   #include <locale.h>

   setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
   gpgme_set_locale (NULL, LC_CTYPE, setlocale (LC_CTYPE, NULL));
   gpgme_set_locale (NULL, LC_MESSAGES, setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, NULL));

   GPGME can not do this for you, as setlocale is not thread safe, and
   there is no alternative.

 * The signal action for SIGPIPE is now set to SIG_IGN by
   gpgme_check_version, instead the first time a crypto engine is
   started (which is not well defined).

 * In the output of gpgme_hash_algo_name, change RMD160 to RIPEMD160,
   TIGER to TIGER192, CRC32-RFC1510 to CRC32RFC1510, and CRC24-RFC2440
   to CRC24RFC2440.  For now, these strings can be used as the MIC
   parameter for PGP/MIME (if appropriately modified).

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.4.2 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_strerror_t		NEW
gpgme_get_key			CHANGED: Fails correctly if key ID not unique.
gpgme_key_t			EXTENDED: New field can_authenticate.
gpgme_subkey_t			EXTENDED: New field can_authenticate.
gpgme_new_signature_t		CHANGED: New type for class field.
gpgme_set_locale		NEW
gpgme_hash_algo_name		CHANGED: Slight adjustment of algo names.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.2 (2003-07-30)
------------------------------------------------

 * Allow gpg-error to be in non-standard place when linking the test suite.

 * Configure will fail now if gpg-error can not be found.

 * Fixed initialized memory backed data objects for writing, which
   caused the test program to crash (but only on Mac OS, surprisingly).

 * Eliminate use of C99 constructs.

 * Small improvements to the manual.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.1 (2003-06-06)
------------------------------------------------

 This is the release that 0.4.0 should have been.  There are many
 interface changes, please see below for the details.  The changes are
 sometimes the result of new functionality, but more often express a
 paradigm shift.  Others are an overdue cleanup to get GPGME in line
 with the GNU coding standards and to make the interface more
 self-consistent.  Here is an overview on the changes:

 All types have been renamed to conform to the GNU coding standards,
 most of the time by keeping the whole name in lowercase and inserting
 underscores between words.

 All operations consistently only accept input parameters in their
 invocation function, and return only an error code directly.  Further
 information about the result of the operation has to be retrieved
 afterwards by calling one of the result functions.  This unifies the
 synchronous and the asynchronous interface.

 The error values have been completely replaced by a more
 sophisticated model that allows GPGME to transparently and accurately
 report all errors from the other GnuPG components, irregardless of
 process boundaries.  This is achieved by using the library
 libgpg-errors, which is shared by all GnuPG components.  This library
 is now required for GPGME.

 The results of all operations are now provided by pointers to C
 structs rather than by XML structs or in other ways.

 Objects which used to be opaque (for example a key) are now pointers
 to accessible structs, so no accessor functions are necessary.

 Backward compatibility is provided where it was possible without too
 much effort and did not collide with the overall sanitization effort.
 However, this is only for ease of transition.  NO DEPRECATED FUNCTION
 OR DATA TYPE IS CONSIDERED A PART OF THE API OR ABI AND WILL BE
 DROPPED IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT CHANGING THE SONAME OF THE LIBRARY.
 Recommendations how to replace deprecated or removed functionality
 can be found within the description of each change.

 What follows are all changes to the interface and behaviour of GPGME
 in detail.

 * If gpgme.h is included in sources compiled by GCC 3.1 or later,
   deprecated attributes will warn about use of obsolete functions and
   type definitions.  You can suppress these warnings by passing
   -Wno-deprecated-declarations to the gcc command.

 * The following types have been renamed.  The old types are still
   available as aliases, but they are deprecated now:
   Old name:		New name:
   GpgmeCtx		gpgme_ctx_t
   GpgmeData		gpgme_data_t
   GpgmeError		gpgme_error_t
   GpgmeDataEncoding	gpgme_data_encoding_t
   GpgmeSigStat		gpgme_sig_stat_t
   GpgmeSigMode		gpgme_sig_mode_t
   GpgmeAttr		gpgme_attr_t
   GpgmeValidity	gpgme_validity_t
   GpgmeProtocol	gpgme_protocol_t
   GpgmeKey		gpgme_key_t
   GpgmePassphraseCb	gpgme_passphrase_cb_t
   GpgmeProgressCb	gpgme_progress_cb_t
   GpgmeIOCb		gpgme_io_cb_t
   GpgmeRegisterIOCb	gpgme_register_io_cb_t
   GpgmeRemoveIOCb	gpgme_remove_io_cb_t
   GpgmeEventIO		gpgme_event_io_t
   GpgmeEventIOCb	gpgme_event_io_cb_t
   GpgmeIOCbs		gpgme_io_cbs
   GpgmeDataReadCb	gpgme_data_read_cb_t
   GpgmeDataWriteCb	gpgme_data_write_cb_t
   GpgmeDataSeekCb	gpgme_data_seek_cb_t
   GpgmeDataReleaseCb	gpgme_data_release_cb_t
   GpgmeDataCbs		gpgme_data_cbs_t
   GpgmeTrustItem	gpgme_trust_item_t
   GpgmeStatusCode	gpgme_status_code_t

 * gpgme_error_t is now identical to gpg_error_t, the error type
   provided by libgpg-error.  More about using libgpg-error with GPGME
   can be found in the manual.  All error symbols have been removed!

 * All functions and types in libgpg-error have been wrapped in GPGME.
   The new types are gpgme_err_code_t and gpgme_err_source_t.  The new
   functions are gpgme_err_code, gpgme_err_source, gpgme_error,
   gpgme_err_make, gpgme_error_from_errno, gpgme_err_make_from_errno,
   gpgme_err_code_from_errno, gpgme_err_code_to_errno,
   gpgme_strsource.

 * GPGME_ATTR_IS_SECRET is not anymore representable as a string.

 * GnuPG 1.2.2 is required.  The progress callback is now also invoked
   for encrypt, sign, encrypt-sign, decrypt, verify, and
   decrypt-verify operations.  For verify operations on detached
   signatures, the progress callback is invoked for both the detached
   signature and the plaintext message, though.

 * gpgme_passphrase_cb_t has been changed to not provide a complete
   description, but the UID hint, passphrase info and a flag
   indicating if this is a repeated attempt individually, so the user
   can compose his own description from this information.

   The passphrase is not returned as a C string, but must be written
   to a file descriptor directly.  This allows for secure passphrase
   entries.

   The return type has been changed to gpgme_error_t value.  This
   allowed to remove the gpgme_cancel function; just return
   the error code GPG_ERR_CANCELED in the passphrase callback directly.

 * gpgme_edit_cb_t has been changed to take a file descriptor argument.
   The user is expected to write the response to the file descriptor,
   followed by a newline.

 * The recipients interface has been removed.  Instead, you use
   NULL-terminated lists of keys for specifying the recipients of an
   encryption operation.  Use the new encryption flag
   GPGME_ENCRYPT_ALWAYS_TRUST if you want to override the validity of
   the keys (but note that in general this is not a good idea).

   This change has been made to the prototypes of gpgme_op_encrypt,
   gpgme_op_encrypt_start, gpgme_op_encrypt_sign and
   gpgme_op_encrypt_sign_start.

   The export interface has been changed to use pattern strings like
   the keylist interface.  Thus, new functions gpgme_op_export_ext and
   gpgme_op_export_ext_start have been added as well.  Now the
   prototypes of gpgme_op_export_start and gpgme_op_export finally
   make sense.

 * gpgme_op_verify and gpgme_op_decrypt_verify don't return a status
   summary anymore.  Use gpgme_get_sig_status to retrieve the individual
   stati.

 * gpgme_io_cb_t changed from a void function to a function returning
   a gpgme_error_t value.  However, it will always return 0, so you
   can safely ignore the return value.

 * A new I/O callback event GPGME_EVENT_START has been added.  The new
   requirement is that you must wait until this event until you are
   allowed to call the I/O callback handlers previously registered for
   this context operation.  Calling I/O callback functions for this
   context operation before the start event happened is unsafe because
   it can lead to race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.

 * The idle function feature has been removed.  It was not precisely
   defined in a multi-threaded environment and is obsoleted by the
   user I/O callback functions.  If you still need a simple way to
   call something while waiting on one or multiple asynchronous
   operations to complete, don't set the HANG flag in gpgme_wait (note
   that this will return to your program more often than the idle
   function did).

 * gpgme_wait can return NULL even if hang is true, if an error
   occurs.  In that case *status contains the error code.

 * gpgme_get_engine_info was radically changed.  Instead an XML
   string, an info structure of the new type gpgme_engine_info_t is
   returned.  This makes it easier and more robust to evaluate the
   information in an application.

 * The new function gpgme_get_protocol_name can be used to convert a
   gpgme_protocol_t value into a string.

 * The status of a context operation is not checked anymore.  Starting
   a new operation will silently cancel the previous one.  Calling a
   function that requires you to have started an operation before without
   doing so is undefined.

 * The FPR argument to gpgme_op_genkey was removed.  Instead, use the
   gpgme_op_genkey_result function to retrieve a gpgme_genkey_result_t
   pointer to a structure which contains the fingerprint.  This also
   works with gpgme_op_genkey_start.  The structure also provides
   other information about the generated keys.

   So, instead:

   char *fpr;
   err = gpgme_op_genkey (ctx, NULL, NULL, &fpr);
   if (!err && fpr)
     printf ("%s\n", fpr);

   you should now do:

   gpgme_genkey_result_t result;
   err = gpgme_op_genkey (ctx, NULL, NULL);
   if (!err)
     {
       result = gpgme_op_genkey_result (ctx);
       if (result->fpr)
         printf ("%s\n", result->fpr);
     }

 * The new gpgme_op_import_result function provides detailed
   information about the result of an import operation in
   gpgme_import_result_t and gpgme_import_status_t objects.
   Thus, the gpgme_op_import_ext variant is deprecated.

 * The new gpgme_op_sign_result function provides detailed information
   about the result of a signing operation in gpgme_sign_result_t,
   gpgme_invalid_key_t and gpgme_new_signature_t objects.

 * The new gpgme_op_encrypt_result function provides detailed
   information about the result of an encryption operation in
   a GpgmeEncryptResult object.

 * The new gpgme_op_decrypt_result function provides detailed
   information about the result of a decryption operation in
   a GpgmeDecryptResult object.

 * The new gpgme_op_verify_result function provides detailed
   information about the result of an verify operation in
   a GpgmeVerifyResult object.  Because of this, the GPGME_SIG_STAT_*
   values, gpgme_get_sig_status, gpgme_get_sig_ulong_attr,
   gpgme_get_sig_string_attr and gpgme_get_sig_key are now deprecated,
   and gpgme_get_notation is removed.

 * GpgmeTrustItem objects have now directly accessible data, so the
   gpgme_trust_item_get_string_attr and gpgme_trust_item_get_ulong_attr
   accessor functions are deprecated.  Also, reference counting is
   available through gpgme_trust_item_ref and gpgme_trust_item_unref
   (the gpgme_trust_item_release alias for the latter is deprecated).

 * Keys are not cached internally anymore, so the force_update argument
   to gpgme_get_key has been removed.

 * GpgmeKey objects have now directly accessible data so the
   gpgme_key_get_string_attr, gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr,
   gpgme_key_sig_get_string_attr and gpgme_key_sig_get_ulong_attr
   functions are deprecated.  Also, gpgme_key_release is now
   deprecated.  The gpgme_key_get_as_xml function has been dropped.

 * Because all interfaces using attributes are deprecated, the
   GpgmeAttr data type is also deprecated.

 * The new gpgme_op_keylist_result function provides detailed
   information about the result of a key listing operation in
   a GpgmeKeyListResult object.

 * Now that each function comes with its own result retrieval
   interface, the generic gpgme_get_op_info interface is not useful
   anymore and dropped.

 * The type and mode of data objects is not available anymore.

------------------------------------------------

 * GPGME_ATTR_OTRUST is implemented now.

 * A first step toward thread safeness has been achieved, see the
   documentation for details.  Supported thread libraries are pthread

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.6 (2002-05-03)
------------------------------------------------

 * All error output of the gpgsm backend is send to the bit bucket.

 * The signature verification functions are extended.  Instead of
   always returning GPGME_SIG_STATUS_GOOD, the functions new codes for
   expired signatures.  2 new functions may be used to retrieve more
   detailed information like the signature expiration time and a
   validity information of the key without an extra key looking.

 * The current passphrase callback and progress meter callback can be
   retrieved with the new functions gpgme_get_passphrase_cb and
   gpgme_get_progress_cb respectively.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.5 (2002-04-01)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpgme_op_encrypt can be called with RECIPIENTS being 0.  In this
   case, symmetric encryption is performed.  Note that this requires a
   passphrase from the user.

 * More information is returned for X.509 certificates.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.4 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_op_encrypt		EXTENDED: Symmetric encryption possible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.4 (2002-03-04)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpgme_op_encrypt does now fail with GPGME_Invalid_Recipients if
   some recipients have been invalid, whereas earlier versions
   succeeded in this case.  The plaintext is still encrypted for all valid
   recipients, so the application might take this error as a hint that
   the ciphertext is not usable for all requested recipients.
   Information about invalid recipients is available with gpgme_get_op_info.

 * gpgme_op_verify now allows to pass an uninitialized data object as
   its plaintext argument to check for normal and cleartext
   signatures.  The plaintext is then returned in the data object.

 * New interfaces gpgme_set_include_certs and gpgme_get_include_certs
   to set and get the number of certifications to include in S/MIME
   signed messages.

 * New interfaces gpgme_op_encrypt_sign and gpgme_op_encrypt_sign_start
   to encrypt and sign a message in a combined operation.

 * New interface gpgme_op_keylist_ext_start to search for multiple patterns.

 * gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr supports the GPGME_ATTR_EXPIRE attribute.

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.3 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_op_encrypt		CHANGED: Can fail with GPGME_Invalid_Recipients
gpgme_op_verify			EXTENDED: Accepts uninitialized text argument
gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr	EXTENDED: Supports GPGME_ATTR_EXPIRE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.3 (2002-02-12)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fix the Makefile in jnlib.

 * Fix the test suite (hopefully).  It should clean up all its state
   with `make check' now.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.2 (2002-02-10)
------------------------------------------------

 * Remove erroneous dependency on libgcrypt in jnlib.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.1 (2002-02-09)
------------------------------------------------

 * There is a Texinfo manual documenting the API.

 * The gpgme_set_keylist_mode function returns an error, and changed
   its meaning.  It is no longer usable to select between normal and
   fast mode (newer versions of GnuPG will always be fast), but
   selects between local keyring, remote keyserver, or both.
   For this, two new macros are defined, GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL
   and GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN.  To make it possible to modify the
   current setting, a fucntion gpgme_get_keylist_mode was added to
   retrieve the current mode.

 * gpgme_wait accepts a new argument STATUS to return the error status
   of the operation on the context.  Its definition is closer to
   waitpid() now than before.

 * The LENGTH argument to gpgme_data_new_from_filepart changed its
   type from off_t to the unsigned size_t.

 * The R_HD argument to the GpgmePassphraseCb type changed its type
   from void* to void**.

 * New interface gpgme_op_trustlist_end() to match
   gpgme_op_keylist_end().

 * The CryptPlug modules have been renamed to gpgme-openpgp and
   gpgme-smime, and they are installed in pkglibdir by `make install'.

 * An idle function can be registered with gpgme_register_idle().

 * The GpgSM backend supports key generation with gpgme_op_genkey().

 * Interface changes relative to the 0.3.0 release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_data_new_from_filepart	CHANGED: Type of LENGTH is size_t.
GpgmePassphraseCb               CHANGED: Type of R_HD is void **.
gpgme_wait                      CHANGED: New argument STATUS.
gpgme_set_keylist_mode          CHANGED: Type of return value is GpgmeError.
                                The function has a new meaning!
gpgme_get_keylist_mode          NEW
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL        NEW
GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN       NEW
gpgme_op_trustlist_next		NEW
GpgmeIdleFunc                   NEW
gpgme_register_idle             NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.0 (2001-12-19)
------------------------------------------------

 * New interface gpgme_set_protocol() to set the protocol and thus the
   crypto engine to be used by the context.  Currently, the OpenPGP
   and the CMS protocols are supported.  They are specified by the new
   preprocessor symbols GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP and GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS.
   A new context uses the OpenPGP engine by default.

 * gpgme_get_engine_info() returns information for all crypto engines
   compiled into the library.  The XML format has changed.  To
   reliably get the version of a crypto engine, the <version> tag
   after the appropriate <protocol> tag has to be looked for.

 * New interface gpgme_engine_check_version(), obsoleting
   gpgme_check_engine().  Check the version of all engines you are
   supporting in your software.

 * GpgmeKey lists the user ids in the order as they are returned by
   GnuPG, first the primary key with index 0, then the sub-user ids.

 * New operation gpgme_op_decrypt_verify() to decrypt and verify
   signatures simultaneously.

 * The new interface gpgme_op_keylist_end() terminates a pending
   keylist operation.  A keylist operation is also terminated when
   gpgme_op_keylist_next() returns GPGME_EOF.

 * GPGME can be compiled without GnuPG being installed (`--with-gpg=PATH'),
   cross-compiled, or even compiled without support for GnuPG
   (`--without-gpg').

 * GPGME can be compiled with support for GpgSM (GnuPG for S/MIME,
   `--with-gpgsm=PATH').  It is enabled by default if the `gpgsm' is found
   in the path, but it can also be compiled without support for GpgSM
   (`--without-gpgsm').

 * CryptPlug modules for GPGME are included and can be enabled at
   configure time (`--enable-gpgmeplug').  There is one module which
   uses the GnuPG engine (`gpgmeplug') and one module which uses the
   GpgSM engine (`gpgsmplug').

 * Interface changes relative to the latest 0.2.x release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
gpgme_key_get_as_xml		CHANGED: Sub-user ids reversed in order.
gpgme_key_get_string_attr	CHANGED: User ids reversed in order.
gpgme_key_get_ulong_attr	CHANGED: User ids reversed in order.
gpgme_get_engine_info		CHANGED: New format, extended content.
gpgme_engine_check_version	NEW
gpgme_decrypt_verify_start	NEW
gpgme_decrypt_verify		NEW
gpgme_op_keylist_next		NEW
gpgme_set_protocol		NEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.3 (2001-09-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * New function gpgme_get_op_info which can be used to get the micalg
   parameter needed for MOSS.

 * New functions gpgme_get_armor and gpgme_get_textmode.

 * The usual bug fixes and some minor functionality improvements.

 * Added a simple encryption component for MS-Windows; however the
   build procedure might have some problems.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.2 (2001-06-12)
------------------------------------------------

 * Implemented a key cache.

 * Fixed a race condition under W32 and some other bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.1 (2001-04-02)
------------------------------------------------

 * Changed debug output and GPGME_DEBUG variable (gpgme/debug.c)

 * Handle GnuPG's new key capabilities output and support revocation
   et al. attributes

 * Made the W32 support more robust.
