 * New interface gpgme_set_protocol() to set the protocol and thus the
   crypto engine to be used by the context.  Currently, the OpenPGP
   and the CMS protocols are supported.  They are specified by the new
   preprocessor symbols GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP and GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS.
   A new context uses the OpenPGP engine by default.

 * gpgme_get_engine_info() returns information for all crypto engines
   compiled into the library.  The XML format has changed.  To
   reliably get the version of a crypto engine, the <version> tag
   after the appropriate <protocol> tag has to be looked for.

 * New interface gpgme_engine_check_version(), obsoleting
   gpgme_check_engine().  Check the version of all engines you are
   supporting in your software.

 * GpgmeKey lists the user ids in the order as they are returned by
   GnuPG, first the primary key with index 0, then the sub-user ids.

 * New operation gpgme_op_decrypt_verify() to decrypt and verify
   signatures simultaneously.

 * The new interface gpgme_op_keylist_end() terminates a pending
   keylist operation.  A keylist operation is also terminated when
   gpgme_op_keylist_next() returns GPGME_EOF.

 * GPGME can be compiled without GnuPG being installed (`--with-gpg=PATH'),
   cross-compiled, or even compiled without support for GnuPG
   (`--without-gpg').

 * GPGME can be compiled with support for GpgSM (GnuPG for S/MIME,
   `--with-gpgsm=PATH').  It is enabled by default if the `gpgsm' is found
   in the path, but it can also be compiled without support for GpgSM
   (`--without-gpgsm').

 * CryptPlug modules for GPGME are included and can be enabled at
   configure time (`--enable-gpgmeplug').  There is one module which
   uses the GnuPG engine (`gpgmeplug') and one module which uses the
   GpgSM engine (`gpgsmplug').

   parameter needed for MOSS.

 * New functions gpgme_get_armor and gpgme_get_textmode.

 * The usual bug fixes and some minor functionality improvements.

 * Added a simple encryption component for MS-Windows; however the
   build procedure might have some problems.
