 * GpgmeKey lists the user ids in the order as they are returned by
   GnuPG, first the primary key with index 0, then the sub-user ids.

 * New operation gpgme_op_decrypt_verify() to decrypt and verify
   signatures simultaneously.

 * GPGME can be compiled without GnuPG being installed (`--with-gpg=PATH'),
   cross-compiled, or even compiled without support for GnuPG
   (`--without-gpg').

 * GPGME can be compiled with support for GpgSM (GnuPG for S/MIME,
   `--with-gpgsm=PATH').  It is enabled by default if the `gpgsm' is found
   in the path, but it can also be compiled without support for GpgSM
   (`--without-gpgsm').

 * CryptPlug modules for GPGME are included and can be enabled at
   configure time (`--enable-gpgmeplug').  There is one module which
   uses the GnuPG engine (`gpgmeplug') and one module which uses the
   GpgSM engine (`gpgsmplug').
