	(_gpgme_get_gpg_path): New, suggested by Jan-Oliver.
	* rungpg.c (_gpgme_gpg_spawn): Use new function to get GPG's path.

	* signers.c (gpgme_signers_add): Ooops, one should test code and
	not just write it; the newarr was not assigned.  Thanks to José
	for pointing this out.  Hmmm, still not tested, why shoudl a coder
	test his fix :-)

	* w32-io.c: Does now use reader threads, so that we can use
	WaitForMultipleObjects.

	Does currently only work for W32.
