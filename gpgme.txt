%%name: GPGME

%%short-description: GnuPG Made Easy 

%%full-description:  GPGME is a library designed to make access to
GnuPG easier for applications.  It provides a
High-Level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature
verification and key management.  Currently it uses GnuPG as
its backend but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact it is
planned to add other backends to it.
